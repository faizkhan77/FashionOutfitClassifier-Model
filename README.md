# Fashion Outfit Classifier using SKLearn DecisionTreeClassifier

Welcome to the Fashion Outfit Classifier project repository! This machine learning model, developed using SKLearn in a Jupyter Notebook, is designed to classify fashion outfit images. The model has undergone thorough data collection, cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering, and fine-tuning to ensure accurate predictions.

## Model Overview

### Data Collection and Cleaning

- **Dataset Source:**
  - The dataset used for training and testing the model was collected from [provide_dataset_source_link].
  - Extensive cleaning procedures were implemented to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data integrity.

### Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

- **Data Preparation:**
  - Preprocessing steps involved scaling, normalization, and reshaping of the input data.
  - Feature engineering techniques were applied to extract relevant information from the raw data.

- **One-Hot Encoding:**
  - Categorical features were encoded using one-hot encoding to facilitate model training.

### Model Training

- **Algorithm Selection:**
  - The DecisionTreeClassifier algorithm from SKLearn was chosen for its suitability in image classification tasks.

- **Fine-Tuning:**
  - The model underwent fine-tuning to optimize hyperparameters and improve performance.
  - Cross-validation techniques were employed to ensure robustness.

### Image Classification

- **Fashion Outfit Images:**
  - The trained model can classify fashion outfit images into predefined categories.
  - Provide the model with an outfit image, and it will predict the corresponding category.

## Model Usage

1. **Jupyter Notebook:**
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook (`fashion_outfit_classifier.ipynb`) in your preferred environment.

2. **Run the Notebook:**
   - Execute the notebook cells sequentially to load the data, preprocess it, train the model, and make predictions.

3. **Provide Image Input:**
   - Once the model is trained, you can input fashion outfit images for classification.

## Note

This Fashion Outfit Classifier model is the result of extensive work in data collection, cleaning, preprocessing, and fine-tuning. The choice of the DecisionTreeClassifier algorithm ensures effective image classification for fashion outfits.
